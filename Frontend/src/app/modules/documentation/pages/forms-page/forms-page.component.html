        <code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-form-field{{'>'}}</code> is a component used to wrap several Angular Material components and
        apply common Text field styles such as the underline, floating label, and hint messages. In this document,
        "form field" refers to the wrapper component <code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-form-field{{'>'}}</code> and "form field
        control" refers to the component that the <code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-form-field{{'>'}}</code> is wrapping (e.g. the
        input, textarea, select, etc.) The following Angular Material components are designed to work inside a
        <code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-form-field{{'>'}}</code>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code class="code">{{'<'}}input matNativeControl{{'>'}} & {{'<'}}textarea matNativeControl{{'>'}}</code></li>
        <li><code class="code">{{'<'}}select matNativeControl{{'>'}}</code></li>
        <li><code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-select{{'>'}}</code></li>
        <li><code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-chip-list{{'>'}}</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Form field appearance variants</p>

      <p>
        The <code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-form-field{{'>'}}</code> supports 4 different appearance variants which can be set via
        the appearance input. The legacy appearance is the default style that the
        <code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-form-field{{'>'}}</code> has traditionally had. It shows the input box with an underline
        underneath it. The standard appearance is a slightly updated version of the legacy appearance that has
        spacing that is more consistent with the fill and outline appearances. The fill appearance displays the form
        field with a filled background box in addition to the underline. Finally the outline appearance shows the
        form field with a border all the way around, not just an underline.
        <br><br>

        There are a couple differences to be aware of between the legacy appearance and the newer standard,
        fill, and outline appearances. The <code class="code">matPrefix</code>  and <code class="code">matSuffix</code>  elements are center
        aligned by default for the newer appearances. The Material Design spec shows this as being the standard way
        to align prefix and suffix icons in the newer appearance variants. We do not recommend using text prefix and
        suffixes in the new variants because the label and input do not have the same alignment. It is therefore
        impossible to align the prefix or suffix in a way that looks good when compared with both the label and input text.
        <br><br>

        The second important difference is that the standard, fill, and outline appearances do not promote
        placeholders to labels. For the legacy appearance specifying <code class="code">{{'<'}}input placeholder="placeholder"{{'>'}}</code> will result
        in a floating label being added to the mat-form-field. For the newer variants it will just add a normal
        placeholder to the input. If you want a floating label, add a <code class="code">{{'<'}}mat-label{{'>'}}</code> to the mat-form-field.
