      <p class="text">
        A license grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use and incorporate the
        item in your personal or commercial projects. If your end product including an item is going
        to be free to the end user then a Single License is what you need. An Extended License is
        required if the end user must pay to use the end product.

        which you are creating for your own purposes or for your client. You must not incorporate the
        item in a work which is created for redistribution or resale by you or your client. The item
        may not be redistributed or resold. You may not charge users for using your application.
